Introduction
============

* Watch the `introduction lecture <parts/intro.html>`_.

* What is Ruby? 

  * Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, open source language.

* What is Rails?

  * Rails is a web application framework

* Versions

  * The newest version of Ruby is 1.9, the old version is 1.8 
    (1.9 is not fully backward-compatible with 1.8 so not everyone switched from 1.8).
  * The newest version of Rails is 3.2, the old version is 2.x
    (3.2 is not fully backward-compatible with 2.x so not everyone switched from 2.x).

* Gems

  * Packaged modules of ruby code (sort of like C# DLLs but also include the code)

* Installing Ruby On Rails

  * Windows - `RailsInstaller <http://railsinstaller.org/>`_
  * Linux/Mac - Rvm
    Ruby Version Manager - allows running multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine
    (so people can run legacy Ruby 1.8 web apps and new 1.9 web apps side-by-side).

* Development Environment, you can use whatever you want:

  * Vim
  * Sublime Text => recommended for beginners
  * RubyMine
  * NotePad++
